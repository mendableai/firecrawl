# üî• Firecrawl

Empower your AI apps with clean data from any website. Featuring advanced scraping, crawling, and data extraction capabilities.

_This repository is in development, and we‚Äôre still integrating custom modules into the mono repo. It's not fully ready for self-hosted deployment yet, but you can run it locally._

## What is Firecrawl?

[Firecrawl](https://firecrawl.dev?ref=github) is an API service that takes a URL, crawls it, and converts it into clean markdown or structured data. We crawl all accessible subpages and give you clean data for each. No sitemap required. Check out our [documentation](https://docs.firecrawl.dev).

_Pst. hey, you, join our stargazers :)_

### API Key

To use the API, you need to sign up on [Firecrawl](https://firecrawl.dev) and get an API key.

### Features

- [**Scrape**](#scraping): scrapes a URL and get its content in LLM-ready format (markdown, structured data via [LLM Extract](#llm-extraction-beta), screenshot, html)
- [**Crawl**](#crawling): scrapes all the URLs of a web page and return content in LLM-ready format
- [**Map**](#map): input a website and get all the website urls - extremely fast
- [**Search**](#search): search the web and get full content from results
- [**Extract**](#extract): get structured data from single page, multiple pages or entire websites with AI.

### Powerful Capabilities
- **LLM-ready formats**: markdown, structured data, screenshot, HTML, links, metadata
- **The hard stuff**: proxies, anti-bot mechanisms, dynamic content (js-rendered), output parsing, orchestration
- **Customizability**: exclude tags, crawl behind auth walls with custom headers, max crawl depth, etc...
- **Media parsing**: pdfs, docx, images
- **Reliability first**: designed to get the data you need - no matter how hard it is
- **Actions**: click, scroll, input, wait and more before extracting data
- **Batching (New)**: scrape thousands of URLs at the same time with a new async endpoint.

You can find all of Firecrawl's capabilities and how to use them in our [documentation](https://docs.firecrawl.dev)

### Crawling

Used to crawl a URL and all accessible subpages. This submits a crawl job and returns a job ID to check the status of the crawl.

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.firecrawl.dev/v2/crawl \
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    -H 'Authorization: Bearer fc-YOUR_API_KEY' \
    -d '{
      "url": "https://docs.firecrawl.dev",
      "limit": 10,
      "scrapeOptions": {
        "formats": ["markdown", "html"]
      }
    }'
```

Returns a crawl job id and the url to check the status of the crawl.

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "id": "123-456-789",
  "url": "https://api.firecrawl.dev/v2/crawl/123-456-789"
}
```

### Check Crawl Job

  ]
}
```

### Search

Search the web and get full content from results

Firecrawl‚Äôs search API allows you to perform web searches and optionally scrape the search results in one operation.

- Choose specific output formats (markdown, HTML, links, screenshots)
- Search the web with customizable parameters (language, country, etc.)
- Optionally retrieve content from search results in various formats
- Control the number of results and set timeouts

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.firecrawl.dev/v2/search \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer fc-YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -d '{
    "query": "what is firecrawl?",
    "limit": 5
  }'
```

#### Response

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": [
    {
      "url": "https://firecrawl.dev",
      "title": "Firecrawl | Home Page",
      "description": "Turn websites into LLM-ready data with Firecrawl"
    },
    {
      "url": "https://docs.firecrawl.dev",
      "title": "Documentation | Firecrawl",
      "description": "Learn how to use Firecrawl in your own applications"
    }
  ]
}
```

#### With content scraping

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.firecrawl.dev/v2/search \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer fc-YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -d '{
    "query": "what is firecrawl?",
    "limit": 5,
    "scrapeOptions": {
      "formats": ["markdown", "links"]
    }
  }'
```

### Extract (Beta)

Get structured data from entire websites with a prompt and/or a schema.

You can extract structured data from one or multiple URLs, including wildcards:

Single Page:
Example: https://firecrawl.dev/some-page

Multiple Pages / Full Domain
Example: https://firecrawl.dev/*

When you use /*, Firecrawl will automatically crawl and parse all URLs it can discover in that domain, then extract the requested data.

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.firecrawl.dev/v2/extract \
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    -H 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY' \
    -d '{
      "urls": [
        "https://firecrawl.dev/*", 
        "https://docs.firecrawl.dev/", 
        "https://www.ycombinator.com/companies"
      ],
      "prompt": "Extract the company mission, whether it is open source, and whether it is in Y Combinator from the page.",
      "schema": {
        "type": "object",
        "properties": {
          "company_mission": {
            "type": "string"
          },
          "is_open_source": {
            "type": "boolean"
          },
          "is_in_yc": {
            "type": "boolean"
          }
        },
        "required": [
          "company_mission",
          "is_open_source",
          "is_in_yc"
        ]
      }
    }'
```

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "id": "44aa536d-f1cb-4706-ab87-ed0386685740",
  "urlTrace": []
}
```

If you are using the sdks, it will auto pull the response for you:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "company_mission": "Firecrawl is the easiest way to extract data from the web. Developers use us to reliably convert URLs into LLM-ready markdown or structured data with a single API call.",
    "supports_sso": false,
    "is_open_source": true,
    "is_in_yc": true
  }
}
```

### LLM Extraction (Beta)

Used to extract structured data from scraped pages.

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.firecrawl.dev/v2/scrape \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY' \
  -d '{
    "url": "https://www.mendable.ai/",
    "formats": [
      {
        "type": "json",
        "schema": {
          "type": "object",
          "properties": {
            "company_mission": { "type": "string" },
            "supports_sso": { "type": "boolean" },
            "is_open_source": { "type": "boolean" },
            "is_in_yc": { "type": "boolean" }
          }
        }
      }
    ]
  }'
```

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "content": "Raw Content",
    "metadata": {
      "title": "Mendable",
      "description": "Mendable allows you to easily build AI chat applications. Ingest, customize, then deploy with one line of code anywhere you want. Brought to you by SideGuide",
      "robots": "follow, index",
      "ogTitle": "Mendable",
      "ogDescription": "Mendable allows you to easily build AI chat applications. Ingest, customize, then deploy with one line of code anywhere you want. Brought to you by SideGuide",
      "ogUrl": "https://mendable.ai/",
      "ogImage": "https://mendable.ai/mendable_new_og1.png",
      "ogLocaleAlternate": [],
      "ogSiteName": "Mendable",
      "sourceURL": "https://mendable.ai/"
    },
    "json": {
      "company_mission": "Train a secure AI on your technical resources that answers customer and employee questions so your team doesn't have to",
      "supports_sso": true,
      "is_open_source": false,
      "is_in_yc": true
    }
  }
}
```

### Extracting without a schema (New)

You can now extract without a schema by just passing a `prompt` to the endpoint. The llm chooses the structure of the data.

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.firecrawl.dev/v2/scrape \
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    -H 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY' \
    -d '{
      "url": "https://docs.firecrawl.dev/",
      "formats": [
        {
          "type": "json",
          "prompt": "Extract the company mission from the page."
        }
      ]
    }'
```

### Interacting with the page with Actions (Cloud-only)

Firecrawl allows you to perform various actions on a web page before scraping its content. This is particularly useful for interacting with dynamic content, navigating through pages, or accessing content that requires user interaction.

Here is an example of how to use actions to navigate to google.com, search for Firecrawl, click on the first result, and take a screenshot.

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.firecrawl.dev/v2/scrape \
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    -H 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY' \
    -d '{
        "url": "google.com",
        "formats": ["markdown"],
        "actions": [
            {"type": "wait", "milliseconds": 2000},
            {"type": "click", "selector": "textarea[title=\"Search\"]"},
            {"type": "wait", "milliseconds": 2000},
            {"type": "write", "text": "firecrawl"},
            {"type": "wait", "milliseconds": 2000},
            {"type": "press", "key": "ENTER"},
            {"type": "wait", "milliseconds": 3000},
            {"type": "click", "selector": "h3"},
            {"type": "wait", "milliseconds": 3000},
            {"type": "screenshot"}
        ]
    }'
```

### Batch Scraping Multiple URLs (New)

You can now batch scrape multiple URLs at the same time. It is very similar to how the /crawl endpoint works. It submits a batch scrape job and returns a job ID to check the status of the batch scrape.

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.firecrawl.dev/v2/batch/scrape \
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    -H 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY' \
    -d '{
      "urls": ["https://docs.firecrawl.dev", "https://docs.firecrawl.dev/sdks/overview"],
      "formats" : ["markdown", "html"]
    }'
```



## Using Python SDK

### Installing Python SDK

```bash
pip install firecrawl-py
```

### Crawl a website

```python
from firecrawl import Firecrawl

firecrawl = Firecrawl(api_key="fc-YOUR_API_KEY")

# Scrape a website (returns a Document)
doc = firecrawl.scrape(
    "https://firecrawl.dev",
    formats=["markdown", "html"],
)
print(doc.markdown)

# Crawl a website
response = firecrawl.crawl(
    "https://firecrawl.dev",
    limit=100,
    scrape_options={"formats": ["markdown", "html"]},
    poll_interval=30,
)
print(response)
```

### Extracting structured data from a URL

With LLM extraction, you can easily extract structured data from any URL. We support pydantic schemas to make it easier for you too. Here is how you to use it:

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field
from typing import List

class Article(BaseModel):
    title: str
    points: int
    by: str
    commentsURL: str

class TopArticles(BaseModel):
    top: List[Article] = Field(..., description="Top 5 stories")

# Use JSON format with a Pydantic schema
doc = firecrawl.scrape(
    "https://news.ycombinator.com",
    formats=[{"type": "json", "schema": TopArticles}],
)
print(doc.json)
```

## Using the Node SDK

### Installation

To install the Firecrawl Node SDK, you can use npm:

```bash
npm install @mendable/firecrawl-js
```

### Usage

1. Get an API key from [firecrawl.dev](https://firecrawl.dev)
2. Set the API key as an environment variable named `FIRECRAWL_API_KEY` or pass it as a parameter to the `Firecrawl` class.

```js
import Firecrawl from '@mendable/firecrawl-js';

const firecrawl = new Firecrawl({ apiKey: 'fc-YOUR_API_KEY' });

// Scrape a website
const doc = await firecrawl.scrape('https://firecrawl.dev', {
  formats: ['markdown', 'html'],
});
console.log(doc);

// Crawl a website
const response = await firecrawl.crawl('https://firecrawl.dev', {
  limit: 100,
  scrapeOptions: { formats: ['markdown', 'html'] },
});
console.log(response);
```


### Extracting structured data from a URL

With LLM extraction, you can easily extract structured data from any URL. We support zod schema to make it easier for you too. Here is how to use it:

```js
import Firecrawl from '@mendable/firecrawl-js';
import { z } from 'zod';

const firecrawl = new Firecrawl({ apiKey: 'fc-YOUR_API_KEY' });

// Define schema to extract contents into
const schema = z.object({
  top: z
    .array(
      z.object({
        title: z.string(),
        points: z.number(),
        by: z.string(),
        commentsURL: z.string(),
      })
    )
    .length(5)
    .describe('Top 5 stories on Hacker News'),
});

// Use the v2 extract API with direct Zod schema support
const extractRes = await firecrawl.extract({
  urls: ['https://news.ycombinator.com'],
  schema,
  prompt: 'Extract the top 5 stories',
});

console.log(extractRes);
```
